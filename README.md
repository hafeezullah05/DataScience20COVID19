# DataScience20COVID19DS20COV19
Covid19 Global Forecasting

Data Science Project No. 8
Topic of project: Covid19 Global Forecasting

Problem statement:
A pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been in a state of emergency worldwide for some time now, and its impact on everyday life and the world economy in general was barely predictable at the beginning.

Goal:
In this project you will predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in different locations around the world and the number of resulting deaths for future dates. Select 5 countries for which you want to perform your detailed analyses.

Derive resulting recommendations for hospital armament (Does the number of hospital beds have to increase?) and political interventions (Do initial restrictions still make sense? do they still have to be strengthened?).

Final grades will be based on your video-presentation, how good the implementation is, complexity of the models used, hold on the programming language, final visualization of the results, the quality of your report and of the description of the code.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/dylansp/covid19-country-level-data-for-epidemic-model
Additional Information: Alternatively, another dataset with more information can be used. However, please use only publicly available data sets.

General Information: • Kick-off: week 22

• Submission deadline: 17.07.2020, 5 p.m.

Submission:

• Video presentation of data-analytical service (5-7 min.)

• Code repository (zip)

Preferred: Python
• Report (3 pages)

Description of the problem statement, your data base and your individual approach to the problem statement.

Please use the Template for Data Science Projects.

• Description of code

Description of the data organization (like cleaning and preparation of the data).

Description of architecture of the data.

Please include this point as the Appendix in the Template for Data Science Projects, to have both the report and the description of the code in one final document.

Additional Information:

Every week until Friday at 10.00 a.m. you have the opportunity to address questions about the project to Elena Banowitz (elena.banowitz@uni-saarland.de).

• Questions are usually dealt with the following week.

• We ask you not to write several mails within one week, but to collect them and send a bundled mail with all relevant questions.

Please note that we attach particular attention to the self-contained and independent quality of your work.

• Keep your questions to a minimum: Please first discuss your question in detail within your group. In most cases a solution can be found through careful discussion. Only if you have not found a solution, you can contact us until Friday.

• Please present us only your self-created results. No solutions already available on the internet can be used. We will take special attention that no solutions already published in the internet will appear in your work. Adopting public solutions will have a negative impact on the grading.

Note: If a project fails, the participants cannot pass the course as a whole.
